# Minha biblioteca virtual (My virtual bookshelf)

Desktop (and portuguese) version of "My virtual bookshelf".

Just like My virtual bookshelf, "Minha biblioteca virtual" is a Book collection management system software, where users can manage their collection, create reading goals, and organize their future readings.

This was my first Python project after doing Codecademy Python courses. I had the chance to put my knowledge into practice, and also learn how to use PyQt5 to create GUI applications and work with SQLite3 in Python.  

To start the application, run the app.py
